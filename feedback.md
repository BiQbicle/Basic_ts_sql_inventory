Project

Name / short description
1. What worked well
    Like it was pretty fun, it worked cus once sql starts working its pretyt like you can say smooth (althoguh bugs are a hassle to fix though :( )

2. What broke / where he got stuck
    Sql was breaking alot, as ive never properly used sql queries and CRUD operations it was abit tricky to get it working properly, plus there isnt alot of content on youtube atleast which specifically used typescript and sqlite together. And the update function was... yeah

3. Workarounds or hints you had to give
    Well claude was used like... alot haha, i (yes im admitting) copied one part of the update codce cus my internet was sofricking bad i had to use it cus browsing was just not working at all and i was frustrated

4. Skills/concepts he actually used (measurable)
    I learnt about making CRUD operations with sqlite and typescript together, better overview on bun, input and output stuff with sql and that yeah.

5. Gaps exposed (missing knowledge, context collapse)
    

6. Emotional signal (frustration / flow / boredom)_
    Internet üíÄ my fucking internet is so ASS that it made me spill to the point im having to swear (i never swear) like even opening a simple blog wasnt working. And i like find it hard to start programming, but once i start coding and get into "the flow" it becomes quite fun. But the first part about learning sql was sorta boring but overall i think worth it

7. Changes needed for beta (scope / clarity / scaffolding)
